<ol>
<li>Place oven rack in the center of the oven. Place <strong>eggs</strong> on the racks.</li>
<li>Place a <strong>cookie sheet</strong> (lined with foil!) underneath the eggs&#8230; just in
case one explodes, cracks, or leaks while cooking.</li>
<li>Set oven to <strong>325 &deg;F</strong> for <strong>30 minutes</strong>.</li>
<li>Remove eggs from oven and place in <strong>ice-cold water</strong>. Peel as soon as they
are cool enough to handle, then return to the water to thoroughly chill.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Tips and Suggestions</h2>

<ul>
<li>How many eggs? About a dozen is about right. Too few (less than six) and
you&#8217;re probably better off with a pot of water; too many (two dozen or more)
and your oven will be a bit crowded.</li>
<li>No ice? Instead, place the bowl in the sink, and leave the water running over
the eggs.</li>
<li>Too many hard-boiled eggs? Try making <a href="/blog/2012/04/simple-egg-salad/">egg salad</a>!</li>

<!-- [Volume 118, Issue 6](http://mathnews.uwaterloo.ca/wordpress/?p=2696) -->


<p><a href="http://mathnews.uwaterloo.ca/">Volume 118, Issue 6</a> of mathNEWS._</p>

<p>We see that in [1], Kalpin continues to detail his wild and unscientific
proposals for the post-secondary school system. While it&#8217;s apparent that Kalpin
is clearly unqualified to be proposing such changes, we also note that there are
any details that need to be worked out in his proposal.</p>

<p>Kalpin notes that secondary school is unable &#8220;to adequately direct students to a
correct post-secondary path&#8221; and unable to prepare students for post-secondary
education. His approach, dividing students into four streams in 9th grade, is
clearly out of touch with the issues plaguing &#8220;typical&#8221; high school students.</p>

<p>The ministry of education itself notes in [2] that in 2003-2004, nearly 1 in 3
students failed to complete a secondary school diploma, let alone advance to
university. For the 2009-2010 year, that has only improved to 1 in 5 students.
This means that nearly 20% of students will be forced to navigate the world with
whatever skills that, at worst, they have acquired in elementary school.</p>

<p>Kalpin introducing integrals and linear algebra into the high school curriculum,
where students already struggle with the pace at which concepts are introduced.
While the secondary school system once did introduce such concepts, they did so
when OAC, the fifth year of high school, still existed, and there was sufficient
time for high-school students to absorb such concepts and still be well-rounded
when they graduated. Introducing such concepts to the exclusion of other classes
(such as Computer Science or Visual Arts) could severely hinder a student&#8217;s
ability to apply the results of upper-year courses like CS 488/688.</p>

<p>Kalpin proposes two radical changes to provide enough funding for his radical
changes: the abolishment of the Catholic school system, and the removal of
all-day kindergarten. We note that many the Catholic school system, arguably, is
better able to promote STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics)
skills in young children &#8211; as demonstrated by the sheer number of catholic
(and, for that matter, french immersion) schools that participate in STEM
programs such as the FIRST Lego League and FIRST Robotics Competition, compared
to the number of public schools that do so.</p>

<p>With regards to the removal of all-day kindergarten, we note that all-day
kindergarten gives one more time to build social and soft skills in early
childhood, where early childhood educators can intervene as necessary.
Underdeveloped soft skills are a leading rationale for programs such as PDEng.
Besides, wouldn&#8217;t you love more time to play with your friends?</p>

<p>Once again, we note how unfeasible such broad sweeping changes would be.
Instead, I repeat my plea for disruptive changes to education from the bottom
up. Apply for a Winter 2013 internship with the Khan Academy. Apply to
Desire2Learn on JobMine. Apply to VeloCity, and disrupt the world with your own
startup in the education industry.</p>

<p>Something more than just writing a whiny article in the paper. <em>Anything.</em>
Please. I&#8217;ve done my part; and I hope you&#8217;ll do yours.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/images/WP_000248.jpg" alt="Software Engineering Design Symposium 2012" /></p>

<p>Today, fourth-year Software Engineering students showed off the fourth-year
design projects they&#8217;ve been working on over the last three terms,
demonstrating the scope of what they&#8217;ve learned over the past five years
they&#8217;ve spent at the University of Waterloo.</p>

<h2>Michael&#8217;s Picks</h2>

<p>For future reference, here are a few that I liked:</p>

<h3>Team 5: Synthesizing Iterators from Declarative Abstraction Functions (Whyness)</h3>

<ul>
<li>Research-focused</li>
<li>Code that generates code</li>
<li>Elegant poster</li>
</ul>


<h3>Team 6: Locally Integrated Multi-Brain Systems (Causal)</h3>

<ul>
<li>Pretty colours!</li>
<li>Real client: professor from political science dept.</li>
<li>Feels like &#8220;magic&#8221;</li>
<li>Clever undo/redo architecture to handle black-box components (not just command or memento patterns)</li>
</ul>


<h3>Team 7: Pathways (Deferred)</h3>

<ul>
<li>Proxy client: real client in London, UK; local professor with domain knowledge represented during meetings</li>
<li>Replicated diagrams shown in client&#8217;s research papers; added graphical editing (direct manip.)</li>
</ul>


<h3>Team 10: Verifyy</h3>

<ul>
<li>Chopsticks (tactile prop) for demo &#8211; keeps visitors engaged</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Branching undo/redo/replay for learning how to draw</li>
<li>Reasonably simple mental model</li>
<li>Rough around the edges wrt UX, but functionally complete</li>
</ul>


<h2>Tips From 4Bs</h2>

<ul>
<li>Start early</li>
<li>Choose members based on shared interests

<ul>
<li>Temptation to choose people you already know</li>
<li>Friends might not be equally invested in your project ideas / your interests

<ul>
<li>Work might not be distributed evenly if someone isn&#8217;t passionate</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Communicate expectations clearly and regularly

<ul>
<li>What technologies used?</li>
<li>Level of familiarity with technologies, on-boarding time

<ul>
<li>e.g. Should you really use django if you&#8217;re the only person on your team that knows Python?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What got done this week (ala scrum/agile)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Meet often

<ul>
<li>Living together &#x21d4; impromptu meetings</li>
<li>Telecommuting &#x21d4; out of sight, out of mind</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Coordinate electives

<ul>
<li>If everyone takes real-time (trains), shared deadlines will be stressful</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Research competitors early

<ul>
<li>Helps avoid late-stage (i.e. 4A) redesigns</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Have a good client</li>
<li>Ladies: During symposium, wear comfortable shoes (flats, not heels!)

<ul>
<li>Standing for a good eight to ten hours; grad ball the next night in the worst case</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>I originally wrote this article for
<a href="http://mathnews.uwaterloo.ca/wordpress/?p=2464">Volume 118, Issue 5</a>
of mathNEWS.</em></p>

<p>Like it or not, University acts as a filter. Upper-year classes are often hollow shells of their first-year selves, as students are hemorrhaged over the terms. In [1], Kalpin argues that students&#8217; failures are the result of an inadequate secondary school system. In this article, we hope to propose alternate hypotheses and paradigms for this &#8220;problem&#8221;.</p>

<p>First, we note that Kalpin&#8217;s argument considers a specific case, and does not consider students who do not enter the University from an Ontario High School. In particular, a number of students are admitted from other post-secondary institutions, CEGEP, other provinces, and from abroad. Without demonstrable evidence that these groups are doing better than students who enter immediately after obtaining their OSSD, it&#8217;s hard to conclude that the school system is at fault.</p>

<p>We again note that Kalpin&#8217;s argument considers a specific case, and does not consider the effects of early childhood learning and reinforcement. In [2], Bronson summarizes the result of a paper out of Columbia, noting that students who are told they are &#8220;smart&#8221; would avoid risk-taking and were less able to recover after failure. Arguably, this, as much as exposure to difficult concepts in high school, could have a huge effect on students ability to recover after, say, failing a midterm or assignment.</p>

<p>In [3], Roman discusses how preconceptions developed in high school can interfere with students ability to develop their mental model of programming and with computers. We note that Kalpin is not required to take Scheme, as a result of curriculum changes in the Software Engineering program, and thus may not yet realize the benefits of exposure to functional programming, or the paradigm shifts required to write code in a functional style after having programmed imperatively for many months.</p>

<p>Finally, I&#8217;d like to explore some potential solutions to the issues presented by Kalpin in [1]. Many students encounter difficulty at all grades as a result of a poor understanding of the fundamentals &#8211; it&#8217;s not uncommon to send a student on their merry way if they get a 60% tests on addition or multiplication in second or third grade. If a student only understands 60% of multiplication, how do we expect them to understand integration, differentiation, or for that matter, feedback control systems? Self-paced learning and review from organizations such as Udacity, MITx, and Khan Academy can help students review the basics, so that they&#8217;ll be better prepared for the real learning, thinking, and innovation that can happen here.</p>

<p>Realistically, innovation is what we want here. I highly doubt that Kalpin will be able to gain enough political support in order to dictate policy changes to the Minstry of Education. Instead, it makes more sense to disrupt education from the bottom up &#8211; schools are starting to realize that YouTube can be a useful learning resource, and at Waterloo we really do have an opportunity to make the future better for incoming students, and, eventually, for our own children. Don&#8217;t think that level of disruption is out of your grasp &#8211; in [4], one Waterloo student has already documented how he&#8217;s changed the world of education.</p>

<p>How will you change the world today?</p>
