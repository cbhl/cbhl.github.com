Disclaimer: IANAL.

Several students in my class recieved their Grad Photo Proofs today. You
know how I know? Because a whole bunch of them posted their proofs to Facebook,
verbatim. That bothers me. I received my proofs too, but I don't intend to
publishing them to Facebook. Why? Because I think that using proofs for anything
other than ordering prints is stealing.

I understand that some of you don't have the highest respect for the
photographers that came to the University to do your grad photos. Maybe it's
sticker shock -- top-tier packages for photos in elementary school probably
didn't cost over $300. Maybe it's because you had difficulty booking your grad
photo session because the site always ran out of slots. Maybe it's because you
re-used a password on the grad photo booking site (tsk, tsk) only to find out
(THE HORROR!) that they store the password in plain text (and send it back to
you by e-mail, to boot). I get that.

But, as software developers, and potential engineers-to-be, many of us rely on
others to pay for our software, so that we have a bed to sleep on and food to
eat. The idealist in me would like to rely solely on open source, but the
reality is that I use a lot of proprietary software (GitHub, Dropbox, Pushover,
Remember the Milk, Google Music, XBox Live, Halo 4, FEZ, ilomilo, and -- as much
as I hate to admit it -- the odd copy of Windows 8 and Microsoft Office). I make
a point to only use proprietary software if I have a valid license for it. If I
don't on a valid license, I either buy one, or I don't use the software.  To do
anything else would be hypocritical. I expect that my classmates, some of whom
may seek out their P. Eng, operate under similar principles.

Similarly, I would expect professional photographers to properly pay for
licenses for software they use in their trade. A single license for Adobe's
Creative Suite 6 Design Standard costs roughly $1300 USD. Adobe's Creative
Cloud for teams costs $840 USD/year/seat. (Remember, these are professionals,
not prosumers. I am going to assume that they're not going to use an $80 USD
copy of Apple's Aperture.)

The resulting conclusion? I think it's a big problem to take proofs from a
photographer and put them on Facebook, and then turn around and expect them to
pay for software. We need to compensate photographers properly for the service
they provide. They sat in that tiny room in the Davis Centre all day, despite
the many people who decided to cancel the morning of their appointment. Plus,
they had all those lights, the camera, the sash, the gown, and that strange
backdrop machine all ready to go so you could be in and out in ten minutes.

The photographers I know wouldn't want you to display proofs publicly. They
optimize the process for creating proofs so that they can have a fast
turn-around time. That usually means using a bulk editing script, linear (not
cubic) interpolation, and waiting for an order before doing touch-ups.

What drove me over the edge, and led me to write this post at 3 AM, is the one
person -- someone who I otherwise deeply respect, technically -- that chose
to *crop the watermark out of their proof and set it as their display picture*.
First, the cropping completely ruins the framing and composition of the photo.
Second, the whole point of the watermark is to deter you from using the proof
for unintended uses -- such as, putting it up as your profile picture on
Facebook. Could you not have waited the four weeks for paper copies and scanned
one of those? We don't even graduate for another 11 months -- posting grad
profile photos can wait.

By the way:

- Copyright law allows the *photographer* to prevent you from using the photo in
  ways that they don't want, because the *photographer* owns the copyright to
  the photo.
- Moral and publicity rights allow *you* to prevent the photographer from using
  the photo in ways that you don't want. (IIRC, moral rights are a Canadian
  concept and do not exist in the US.)
- Under Facebook's [Statement of Rights and Responsibilities][0], subsection 2.1
  reads, "For content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like
  photos ...  you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable,
  royalty-free, worldwide license to use [the photos]." Because you don't own
  the copyright, you can't grant this license to Facebook. So delete those
  photos from Facebook, until you have the copyright transferred to you in
  writing.

**P.S.** If you hated dealing with the grad photo booking and ordering systems
at least as much as I did, consider rebooting your Fourth Year Design
Project to build a more usable and secure system for grad photo booking and ordering. Even if
Newschool Photograph decides they don't want to be your customer, you can
probably find some professional photographer who is savvy enough to
appreciate the help of a few software developers. We have almost nine whole months
until symposium.  We are all in fourth year. If you're not going to build
something technically interesting ("cool") -- damn the bureaucracy -- you
may as well build something that will make people's lives a little bit easier.
