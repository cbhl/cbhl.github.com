1. Preheat oven to **275 F (135 C)**.
2. Line **16 muffin tins** with paper liners. (Fill empty slots in a
   muffin tin with water.)
3. Place **one Oreo (whole)** in the bottom of each of the sixteen cups.
4. Beat **2 8-oz packages cream cheese**.
5. Gradually beat in **1/2 cup sugar** and **1/2 teaspoon vanilla**.
6. Gradually pour in **2 large eggs, lightly beaten**.
7. Beat in **1/2 cup sour cream** and a **pinch of salt**.
8. **Pour** batter into the tins, filling each almost to the top.
9. **Bake**, rotating pan halfway through, until filling is set (about
   22-25 minutes).
10. **Cool** in pans at least 15 minutes, then **refrigerate** at least
    four hours.

Tips and Suggestions
--------------------

- If you're okay with shorter cheesecakes, you could probably split
  the batter over 18 tins instead of 16, though you'll need two more
  Oreo cookies.
- If you do fill the empty cups with water, remove the cheesecakes
  before refrigerating, and set them on a cloth towel on a plate, as
  moisture will accumulate on the bottoms if left in the pan.
- Consider mixing in dried fruit, like dried cranberries.
- Try piping strawberry jelly through a plastic bag to decorate the
  cheesecakes prior to baking.
