Rolls
-----

Unroll two cans of crescents into eight rectangles. Pinch the diagonal edge.

Microwave 1/2 cup butter, 1/4 cup sugar, 4 tbsp. cinnamon (?) until the consistency of frosting (~20 sec). Edges just melting.

Divide cinnamon-sugar mixture over crescent rolls, ~1tbsp per sheet. Roll each sheet up, then cut into 1" pieces (about 4-5 per roll).

Lay pieces on foil cookie sheet, cut side down. Bake at 375 &deg;F for 12 minutes, until golden brown.
