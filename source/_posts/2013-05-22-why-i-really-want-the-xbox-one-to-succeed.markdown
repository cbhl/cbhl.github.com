I feel like people are underwhelmed by the idea of the Xbox One that was
announced earlier this week.

Three things worry me about comments like these. First, repeatition is a key
aspect of public speaking. Second, I think converging TV and computers/video
games has the potential to really improve the experience for consumers. Third, I
think that converging TV and computers/video games is not as trivial as the
soundbites would have you believe.

I admit that it's easy to be dismissive of "TV, TV, TV, Sports, and Call of
Duty". The recipe isn't unfamiliar. You can probably already get TV and Sports
from your local incumbent cable provider. Plus, aren't we like on the tenth Call
of Duty game by now? It certainly feels that way to me. However, I think the
YouTube video going around instead demonstrates repeatition, which, my SPCOM 223
professor indicates is a key aspect of Public Speaking. She indicates that you
want to develop two or three key terms, and repeat them throughout your delivery
to help people follow along with what you're telling them. So, you already know
that Xbox is about video games. Now, they want you to remember "Xbox. TV." and
associate the two.

There are a lot of really cool things that TVs and Set-Top Boxes could do from a
technical standpoint. Imagine a DVR that tracks when the TV station starts your
show fifteen minutes early or half an hour late, and adjusts the start and end
times for the recording automatically. Imagine the ability to watch any TV show
later, without having to worry about how long it'll be up on the TV network's
website. Imagine if your TV suggested movies that your friends will enjoy with
you when they come over to visit. Or if it recognized that both you and your
best friend have secretly been catching up on episodes on Netflix and you're
both actually on episode 8, when you both thought the other was still on episode
3. I think, from a technical standpoint, that you could build any of these
things today.

So why don't these features exist? Bringing

1. Repeation is a key aspect of Public Speaking
2. Converging TV and tech has the potential to be desirable for consumers
3. Evidence that converging TV and tech is hard
4. Criticisms
    1. You can already get TV, Sports, and Call of Duty
    1. Always-on DRM and Single Points of Failure
    2. Working with media companies
    3. It's Microsoft / F/OSS stuff.
