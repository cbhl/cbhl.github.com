_Sleep is Important_

It's easy to get caught up in interviews, assignments, projects, midterms, and late nights playing board games. Don't forget to sleep! As much as your friends may brag about getting through the week on three hours of sleep, you'll be much more productive if your manage your energy and get enough sleep through the week.

_Find Your Passion_

You will find many opportunities to make decisions in your life. You might be choosing between sleeping and studying for another three hours, between a co-op opportunity in the San Francisco Bay Area and a co-op opportunity in Kitchener, or between pasta and breaded fish at the cafeteria.

So why are you wasting your time doing things you don't like and that won't take you a step closer to reaching your goals? When you put down this paper, go do something that will make your life better.

_Don't Date Someone From Your Cohort_

If you are (un)fortunate enough to be in a program with a cohort, think **very carefully** before dating someone in your class. There are so many ways it could end horribly. I'll let your imagination run wild here.

_Volunteering_

If you were one of the people who enjoyed volunteering in high school, don't just give up on it now that you're here! Even if you're not in Engineering, WE-Connect, part of Waterloo Engineering Outreach, is involved with many events where you can get involved. Every year, volunteers are needed for the FIRST Lego League and the FIRST Robotics Regional Competition on campus. Become an Orientation leader. Start a business on campus. Run for student government. Get involved!

_Internet_

Whenever you go on Facebook, Twitter, or OMGUW, remember that you're representing the university -- whether you like it or not. We'll have to see whether we're going to clamp down and not put anything on the Internet, or whether we're going to accept that people do stupid things and that it's funny. Until then, think before you post.

Do What You're Passionate About
-------------------------------

- you could die tomorrow (but don't jump in the river)
- why are you wasting your time?
- velocity
- co-op



Relationships
-------------
- Don't Date Someone From Your Class
    - *Bad Scenario 1*: You break up. You have to see (him/her) every term
      during your core courses until you graduate, and hide how much it
      bothers you.
    - *Bad Scenario 2*: You break up. One of you fails a term. Bad feelings
      remain; when you run into each other in the halls, during club
      meetings, or in residence, at least one of you ends up hysterical.
    - *Bad Scenario 3*: You break up. He/she starts dating one of your
      friends. Erm, ex-friends. Nuff said.
    - *Bad Scenario 4*: You break up. Well, you try to. Except s/he still
      calls and emails once every few weeks. Every time, you almost
      give into the temptation to give him/her a second chance. The only
      thing keeping you from doing so are the little voices screaming
      inside your head, and the tight feeling you get in your chest
      every time you read their emails.
    - *Bad Scenario 5*: You get married. Technology advances to the point
      where Software Engineers become obsolete. You consume resources
      until your savings are exhausted, and you die in obscurity.

- Cohort
    - You stick with these people whether you like them or not
    - Dropping a year to align \w nexy graduating class, e.g.

- Co-op
    - Up to 12 months after the mid-point 2B eligible for PEO
    - Where to find PEOs in workforce for PEO assessment

Do their best to...
- Be there
- Be leaders
- Be accountable
- Be professional
- Be constructive

- CSCF, MFCF, Nexus, WatIAM, Quest

Volunteering
------------
- Volunteering for Recruiting - MBOH, WiE, Shadow
- FLL/FRC Regionals
- Engineering Ambassador (NEW!)

- mathNEWS, MathSoC, EngSoC, MEF, WEEF

Right Fit
---------
- Make sure you want to be at Waterloo, in Softare
- If you don't want to be in SE, look at CS, UofT, ECE

Attitude
--------
- Be honest
- Leave a trail (accountability/academic integrity) -- e.g. attach rough work
- Don't forget about stuff
    - Posting photos on FB that you don't want people seeing
    - Twitter / LinkedIn

    We'll have to see whether we're going to clamp down and not put
    anything on the Internet, or whether we're going to accept that
    people do stupid things and that it's funny

- Why I enjoy being here
- Why I feel good about my decision to come to Waterloo Engineering
- Ask about people's lives and opinions; take interest in answer
- Ask about how decisions are made; how often team meets; salary

- Reasoned opinion <=> criticizing w/o merit
