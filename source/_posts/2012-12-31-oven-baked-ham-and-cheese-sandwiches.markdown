_This variant on Oven-Baked Grilled Cheese appeared in Volume 118, Issue 4 of mathNEWS._

1. Pre-heat oven to **400 &deg;F (205 &deg;C)**.
2. **Line (a) cookie sheet(s)** with aluminum foil.
3. Perform n times, once for each sandwich:
   a. Spread **a slice of bread** with **real mayonnaise** on the outer face, and lay mayonnaise side down, on the lined cookie sheet.
   b. Place a **slice of ham** (or five) on top of the slice of bread on the cookie sheet.
   c. Place a **cheese slice** (or two) on top of the slice(s) of ham.
   d. Spread **another slice of bread** with mayonnaise on **both sides**, and lay on top of the cheese slice(s) to form a sandwich.
4. **Bake** for **four to six minutes**, then **flip** the sandwiches and bake for another **three to five minutes**.

_Tip: No mayonnaise? Substitute margarine, but spread it only on the outer faces of the sandwich. Avoid "salad dressing", as it does not have a high enough oil content._
