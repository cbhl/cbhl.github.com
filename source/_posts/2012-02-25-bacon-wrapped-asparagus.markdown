1. Preheat oven to **400 F (205 C)**
2. Line a **cookie sheet** with **aluminum foil**.
3. Wash **10 asparagus shoots (about half a bunch)** and trim the
   bottom 1cm.
4. Wrap each asparagus shoot with a **slice of bacon** in a single
   helix, and lay on the wrapped asparagus on the lined cookie
   sheet in a single layer.
5. Bake for about **20 minutes** until bacon is cooked to desired
   doneness.

Tips and Suggestions
--------------------

- Sometimes I prepare this at 375 F (190 C) to match another dish in
  the oven. You may need to bake for a little longer if you do this.

- **Variant**: Cover half of the shoots with **barbeque sauce**.
  I've tried using Diana&reg; Sauce (Maple), though substituting
  another variety should work. It's normal for a small amount of the
  sauce to start charring on the foil. I find that covering all the
  shoots with barbeque sauce is intoxicatingly rich, so I don't
  usually do it if I plan on eating them all by myself.

- If not serving immediately, drain excess bacon fat either
  into the trash or into a bowl for later use. (Do not put down the
  drain, as it will usually clog.)
