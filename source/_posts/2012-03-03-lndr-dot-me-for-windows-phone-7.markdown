Today was the 5th [SE Hack Day](http://sehackday.com/). I decided to
build a Windows Phone 7 application for
[Peter Sobot](http://petersobot.com)'s laundry-tracking app
[lndr.me](http://lndr.me/).

Having the toolkit and phone already set up and knowing to use Json.NET
really helped make things go more smoothly.

Find the source for
[Lndr.me for Windows Phone 7](https://github.com/cbhl/LndrMeApp) on
GitHub.
