1. Preheat oven to **400 F (205 C)**
2. Line a **cookie sheet** with **aluminum foil**.
3. Spread **four slices of bread** with **mayonaise** on the "outer"
   edges (since you'll be making sandwiches).
4. Place a **cheese slice** between each pair of slices of bread,
   laying the sandwiches on the cookie sheet.
5. Bake for **four to six minutes**, then **flip** the sandwiches
   and bake for **another three to five minutes**. Note that the
   sandwich will brown on the bottom (the side facing the foil), and
   not on the visible (top) side when it's in the oven.

Tips and Suggestions
--------------------

- Use real mayonaise, not "salad dressing", as this intended to
  promote browning and needs a decent fat content. If mayonaise is
  not available, you could probably substitute margarine or butter.
- I tested this with "Thin Sandwich" bread, which has 24 slices in a
  single loaf, and with "Thick" cheese slices.
- You can probably fit three sandwiches on a cookie sheet, but I
  can't eat that much all at once.
- I've only made this recipe once. Consider it a work in progress.

    <li>Pre-heat oven to <strong>400 &deg;F (205 &deg;C)</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Line (a) cookie sheet(s)</strong> with aluminum foil.</li>

    <li>Perform n times, once for each sandwich:</li>
<ol>
    <li>Spread <strong>a slice of bread</strong> with <strong>real mayonnaise</strong> on the outer face, and lay mayonnaise side down, on the lined cookie sheet.</li>
    <li>Place a <strong>slice of ham</strong> (or five) on top of the slice of bread on the cookie sheet.</li>
    <li>Place a <strong>cheese slice</strong> (or two) on top of the slice(s) of ham.</li>
    <li>Spread <strong>another slice of bread</strong> with mayonnaise on <strong>both sides</strong>, and lay on top of the cheese slice(s) to form a sandwich.</li></ol>

    <li><strong>Bake</strong> for <strong>four to six minutes</strong>, then <strong>flip</strong> the sandwiches and bake for another <strong>three to five minutes</strong>.</li>

<em>Tip: No mayonnaise? Substitute margarine, but spread it only on the outer faces of the sandwich. Avoid "salad dressing", as it does not have a high enough oil content.</em>
