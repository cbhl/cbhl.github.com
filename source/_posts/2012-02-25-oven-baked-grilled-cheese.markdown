1. Preheat oven to **400 F (205 C)**
2. Line a **cookie sheet** with **aluminum foil**.
3. Spread **four slices of bread** with **mayonaise** on the "outer"
   edges (since you'll be making sandwiches).
4. Place a **cheese slice** between each pair of slices of bread,
   laying the sandwiches on the cookie sheet.
5. Bake for **four to six minutes**, then **flip** the sandwiches
   and bake for **another three to five minutes**. Note that the
   sandwich will brown on the bottom (the side facing the foil), and
   not on the visible (top) side when it's in the oven.

Tips and Suggestions
--------------------

- Use real mayonaise, not "salad dressing", as this intended to
  promote browning and needs a decent fat content. If mayonaise is
  not available, you could probably substitute margarine or butter.
- I tested this with "Thin Sandwich" bread, which has 24 slices in a
  single loaf, and with "Thick" cheese slices. You'll want to adjust
  the baking time and temperature if using something different.
- You can probably fit three sandwiches on a cookie sheet, but I
  can't eat that much all at once.
