Sleep is Important
------------------

It's easy to get caught up in interviews, assignments, projects,
midterms, and late nights playing board games. Don't forget to sleep!
As much as your friends may brag about getting through the week on
three hours of sleep, you'll be much more productive if your manage
your energy and get enough sleep through the week.

Find Your Passion
-----------------

You will find many opportunities to make decisions in your life. You might
be choosing between sleeping or studying for another three hours, between
a co-op opportunity in the San Francisco Bay Area or a co-op opportunity
in Kitchener, or between pasta or breaded fish at the cafeteria.

So why are you wasting your time doing things you don't like and that 
won't take you a step closer to reaching your goals? When you put down
this paper, go do something that will make your life better.

Don't Date Someone From Your Cohort
-----------------------------------

If you are (un)fortunate enough to be in a program with a cohort, think
**very carefully** before dating someone in your class. There are so many
ways it could end horribly. I'll let your imagination run wild here.

Volunteering
------------

If you were one of the people who enjoyed volunteering in high school,
don't just give up on it now that you're here! Even if you're not in
Engineering, WE-Connect, part of Waterloo Engineering Outreach, is 
involved with many events where you can get involved. Every year,
volunteers are needed for the FIRST Lego League and the FIRST Robotics 
Regional Competition on campus. Become an Orientation leader. Start a
business on campus. Run for student government. Get involved!

Internet
--------

Whenever you go on Facebook, Twitter, or OMGUW, remember that you're
representing the university - whether you like it or not. We'll have to
see whether we're going to clamp down and not put anything on the
Internet, or whether we're going to accept that people do stupid things
and that it's funny. Until then, think before you post.
