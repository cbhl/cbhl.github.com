I've been running this blog on GitHub Pages with Octopress for nearly three
months now. Since Octopress is built on Jekyll, a static site generator, I've
been thinking that there are other ways of hosting static files that may be
worth experimenting with.

So, I'm hosting a copy of this site on
[nearlyfreespeech.net](https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/) as an experiment.
We'll see how it goes.
