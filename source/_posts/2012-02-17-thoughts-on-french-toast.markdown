Attempted to make Baked French Toast today. Some thoughts for next time:

- Bread is supposed to absorb lots of egg/milk mixture. Adding more bread
  is generally a bad idea.
- Consider making egg/milk mixture ahead of time to make the recipe
  easier to prepare. Or let the bread sit in the mixture in the fridge.
- Add lots of cinnamon.
- Consider how to add moisture -- syrup, fruit, jam all come to mind.
