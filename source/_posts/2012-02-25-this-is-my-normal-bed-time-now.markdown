_Remarks on 3A thus far... and passing the halfway point of my undergraduate career._


Windows Mobile 7.5
------------------

Native apps are pretty spiffy.
Tiles are cool, except when they're creepy.
Corporate WPA2/RADIUS Wi-Fi problems are exaberated on this phone, which refuses to maintain a connection to eduroam.
Silverlight apps look native and spiffy, but performance leaves something to be desired. Flickr was really laggy on first load.

Lack of a Google+ API sticks out on a sore thumb when moving to this devices from Android. IE only works with the Basic Mobile site
(understandable) but I can't even upload a photo from the basic site. (Facebook would upload photos no problem, but on the other
hand, Microsoft wrote their own Facebook app so I have no need for the m site.) I know C# and have access to the Win Phone 7
toolkit, but alas.
