Relationships
-------------
- Don't Date Someone From Your Class
    - *Bad Scenario 1*: You break up. You have to see (him/her) every term
      during your core courses until you graduate, and hide how much it
      bothers you.
    - *Bad Scenario 2*: You break up. One of you fails a term. Bad feelings
      remain; when you run into each other in the halls, during club
      meetings, or in residence, at least one of you ends up hysterical.
    - *Bad Scenario 3*: You break up. He/she starts dating one of your
      friends. Erm, ex-friends. Nuff said.
    - *Bad Scenario 4*: You break up. Well, you try to. Except s/he still
      calls and emails once every few weeks. Every time, you almost
      give into the temptation to give him/her a second chance. The only
      thing keeping you from doing so are the little voices screaming
      inside your head, and the tight feeling you get in your chest
      every time you read their emails.
    - *Bad Scenario 5*: You get married. Technology advances to the point
      where Software Engineers become obsolete. You consume resources
      until your savings are exhausted, and you die in obscurity.

    anything on the Internet, or whether we're going to accept that
    people do stupid things and that it's funny
