1. Coarsely chop **6 hard-boiled eggs**. A butter knife works well for this.
2. Add **2 tablespoons mayonaise**.
3. Mix well. Serve.

Tips and Suggestions
--------------------
- For the adventureous, try adding a dash of curry or paprika before mixing.
- Real mayonaise is better than "salad dressing".
- Some like to add finely chopped celery to egg salad. I find it messes up the
  texture, but your mileage may vary.
