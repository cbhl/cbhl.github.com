Rolls
-----

Unroll two cans of crescents into eight rectangles. Pinch the diagonal edge.

Mix 1/2 cup softened butter, 1/4 cup sugar, 1/4 cup cinnamon; should be the consistency of frosting. (Microwave 20 sec. if too firm.)

Divide cinnamon-sugar mixture over crescent rolls, ~1tbsp per sheet. Roll each sheet up, then cut into 1" pieces (about 4-5 per roll).

Lay pieces on foil cookie sheet, cut side down. Bake at 375 &deg;F for 12 minutes, until golden brown.
