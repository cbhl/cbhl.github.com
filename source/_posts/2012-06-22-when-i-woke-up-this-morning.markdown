So you know how you're supposed to plug everything into surge protectors...

Last night, I couldn't access my home server. I assumed the power was out; figured
it just needed someone to boot it in the morning.

This morning: I wake up to this email.

Looks like almost all of it is toast now. :(

Granted most of the equipment at home is rather dated -- Pentium 4s; 4:3 LCD montiors
+ 1 CRT montior; old keyboards and mice. My biggest concern right now is whether the
2TB HDDs survived to the point where I can plug them into a new box to recover the
data on them. (Why didn't I have more data backed up?) I'd been planning to replace
the rest anyway for a while now; just hadn't gotten around to it.
