_Adapted from [food.com](http://www.food.com/recipe/hard-cooked-eggs-in-the-oven-baked-eggs-61856)_

1. Place oven rack in the center of the oven. Place **eggs** on the racks.
2. Place a **cookie sheet** (lined with foil!) underneath the eggs... just in
   case one explodes, cracks, or leaks while cooking.
3. Set oven to **325 &deg;F** for **30 minutes**.
4. Remove eggs from oven and place in **ice-cold water**. Peel as soon as they
   are cool enough to handle, then return to the water to thoroughly chill.

Tips and Suggestions
--------------------

- How many eggs? About a dozen is about right. Too few (less than six) and
  you're probably better off with a pot of water; too many (two dozen or more)
  and your oven will be a bit crowded.
- No ice? Instead, place the bowl in the sink, and leave the water running over
  the eggs.
- Too many hard-boiled eggs? Try making [egg salad](/blog/2012/04/simple-egg-salad/)!
