Integrating with CAS is a pain if you're a student. Facebook Connect seems like
an obvious solution, but some students may be turned off by the privacy
implications. On the other hand, OpenID is too complicated for the average user.
What do you do? Perhaps Mozilla Persona (persona.org) is the answer.

I was posting in a Facebook group the other day, and a little annotation caught
my eye: "Seen by 104". It occurred to me that most of the members in the group
were lurkers. When I post, maybe five or ten people will actually respond with a
comment (as opposed to just clicking 'Like'). But those posts are probably
affecting a much larger number of people. It's hard to fathom what "Seen by 104"
actually means when you don't have those 104 people in front of your face.

Early Adopters are weird. They try new things at a whim, but they're just as
likely to stop using it on a whim if they're not impressed. It seems like
there's nothing quite like a slightly-overbearing parent to encourage early
adoption of technology X or Y in a K-12 school; after all, who would want
anything less than the latest and greatest and shiniest for their offspring?
What bothers me, though, is how caregivers, teachers, and parents alike will
manage to provide appropriate context for all this new-fangled technology. In
the age of dial-up, it was telling kids to not put their address and school on
public forum posts. In the age of tablets and smartphones with apps that upload
your entire contact list to a nondescript server and turn on the GPS on first
run, how do we inform kids about the context in which they're making decisions
about the trade-off between privacy and utility?

Regular expressions in vim are really cool, especially when coupled with block
select. I think I use them every time I write a computer program now. Granted, I
should really set up autoindent...

There's one piece of advice I got from my high-school chemistry teacher: never
drop a course. If you feel like you're failing; take a look around. Chances are,
he said, your classmates feel like they're failing, too, and they're doing worse
than you. Ironically, this advice is useless at face value because I'm
half-Engineer -- I can't drop a course without losing that Engineering half of
me. His message however, still makes sense in a greater world context: Never
Give Up. See things through to the end. There'll be ups and downs, and they will
pass. If you're feeling down: it's okay to cry yourself to sleep; without
moments like these, the good ones wouldn't be as enjoyable. Well, I like to
think that. Perhaps he just meant it literally. I think all that "critical
thinking" in ENGL 108D has been getting to me.

Happy Belated Birthday to Sarah Tan! I hope that by the time this issue comes
out that I actually know what your birthday present is.
