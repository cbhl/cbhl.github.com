Self Reflection

Sucked at writing 
Grade 3 - draft, proofread, rewrite 
Hated it because I wasn't good at it

Outline for 3A reflection 
Engineering-esque process for creative work
Intuition after doing it lots; like practice sets for feedback

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Astronomy - seeing Orion in the night sky
