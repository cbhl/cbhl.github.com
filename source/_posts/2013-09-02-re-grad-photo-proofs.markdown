I received a response from Newschool Photography regarding my previous blog
post. I've posted it below, with their permission.

>   **Subject: Regarding your blog post, re: grad photo proofs**
>   
>   Hello Michael,
>   
>   A Software Engineering graduate from a couple of years ago forwarded a link
>   to [one of your blog entries][gpp] on to us, and asked us our opinions on
>   the matter - how we feel regarding the public sharing of students' grad
>   photo proofs, etc.
>   
>   First of all, as a team of dedicated professionals with genuine care and
>   love for what we do, we would like to thank you for recognising our
>   professional efforts, and respecting them and taking them seriously. It's a
>   compliment to us when the services we love to provide for UW students are
>   equally respected in return.
>   
>   We have never taken issue with people sharing their digital grad photo
>   proofs via Facebook, email, etc.; they are low-resolution, watermarked
>   images, and students have full rights to show them off - we have full faith
>   that no students are using their proof images (which are intended for
>   preview purposes) to make a profit, so we are not concerned at all.
>   
>   As of this year, we also have an [online survey][survey] that we encourage
>   past and present students to fill out - all feedback we receive helps us to
>   gain insight into what students are thinking, and, as such, helps us to
>   improve the service we love to provide.
>   
>   Thank you again for your thoughtfulness! Please feel free to be in touch.
