  <h1>About Michael</h1>
  <p>
    I'm in third year at the
    <a href="http://uwaterloo.ca/">University of Waterloo</a>.
    I'm studying
    <a href="http://softeng.uwaterloo.ca/">Software Engineering</a>
    there, and can be often found at
    <a href="http://velocity.uwaterloo.ca/">VeloCity</a> Residence
    on my school terms -- it's a great place to meet awesome people, build
    things, and experiment.
  </p>
  <p>
    I most recently had a co-op term/internship with
    <a href="http://www.google.com/students">Google</a>.
    I've also worked for
    <a href="http://www.xtremelabs.com/">Xtreme Labs</a>,
    <a href="https://www.facebook.com/careers/university">Facebook</a>, and
    <a href="http://www.sharpschool.com/">SharpSchool</a>.

  <p>
    I have a passion for good food and board games. My favourites
    foods include steak, mashed potatoes, watermelon, bing cherries,
    and nectarines. My favourite board games include Settlers of Catan,
    Dominion, Scrabble, and Monopoly Deal.
