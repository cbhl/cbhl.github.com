  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>I originally wrote this article for
<a href="http://mathnews.uwaterloo.ca/wordpress/?p=2464">Volume 118, Issue 5</a>
of mathNEWS.</em></p>

<p>Like it or not, University acts as a filter. Upper-year classes are often hollow shells of their first-year selves, as students are hemorrhaged over the terms. In [1], Kalpin argues that students&#8217; failures are the result of an inadequate secondary school system. In this article, we hope to propose alternate hypotheses and paradigms for this &#8220;problem&#8221;.</p>

<p>First, we note that Kalpin&#8217;s argument considers a specific case, and does not consider students who do not enter the University from an Ontario High School. In particular, a number of students are admitted from other post-secondary institutions, CEGEP, other provinces, and from abroad. Without demonstrable evidence that these groups are doing better than students who enter immediately after obtaining their OSSD, it&#8217;s hard to conclude that the school system is at fault.</p>

<p>We again note that Kalpin&#8217;s argument considers a specific case, and does not consider the effects of early childhood learning and reinforcement. In [2], Bronson summarizes the result of a paper out of Columbia, noting that students who are told they are &#8220;smart&#8221; would avoid risk-taking and were less able to recover after failure. Arguably, this, as much as exposure to difficult concepts in high school, could have a huge effect on students ability to recover after, say, failing a midterm or assignment.</p>

<p>In [3], Roman discusses how preconceptions developed in high school can interfere with students ability to develop their mental model of programming and with computers. We note that Kalpin is not required to take Scheme, as a result of curriculum changes in the Software Engineering program, and thus may not yet realize the benefits of exposure to functional programming, or the paradigm shifts required to write code in a functional style after having programmed imperatively for many months.</p>

<p>Finally, I&#8217;d like to explore some potential solutions to the issues presented by Kalpin in [1]. Many students encounter difficulty at all grades as a result of a poor understanding of the fundamentals &#8211; it&#8217;s not uncommon to send a student on their merry way if they get a 60% tests on addition or multiplication in second or third grade. If a student only understands 60% of multiplication, how do we expect them to understand integration, differentiation, or for that matter, feedback control systems? Self-paced learning and review from organizations such as Udacity, MITx, and Khan Academy can help students review the basics, so that they&#8217;ll be better prepared for the real learning, thinking, and innovation that can happen here.</p>

<p>Realistically, innovation is what we want here. I highly doubt that Kalpin will be able to gain enough political support in order to dictate policy changes to the Minstry of Education. Instead, it makes more sense to disrupt education from the bottom up &#8211; schools are starting to realize that YouTube can be a useful learning resource, and at Waterloo we really do have an opportunity to make the future better for incoming students, and, eventually, for our own children. Don&#8217;t think that level of disruption is out of your grasp &#8211; in [4], one Waterloo student has already documented how he&#8217;s changed the world of education.</p>

<p>How will you change the world today?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>tl;dr: Sleep is good. RTM, Google Calendar, Inbox Zero. VeloCity vs mathNEWS.
Ignoring my health, at my own peril. VeloCity peeps keeping me sane. Sleep
will have to wait.</p>

<p>So, this post is nearly three weeks overdue. It was <em>supposed</em> to be a
collection of remarks on 3A thus far&#8230; and passing the halfway point of my
undergraduate career. Alas, my less-than-perfect time-management skills got in
the way, and so here I am, reflecting on something like 5/6ths of it instead.</p>

<p>I think the biggest change this term has been my messed-up sleep habits. Once
upon a time, I went to bed at 10pm and woke up at 8am, and all was good. Sure,
there was the odd late night, but those were the exception rather than the
norm. This term has been characterized by spending many nights awake between
midnight and five or six AM, and sleeping just about any other moment where I
can sneak in an hour or three. It&#8217;s dreadfully unpleasant because I find that
I can&#8217;t remember what&#8217;s happened the day before, let alone in the past week,
but on the other hand, working in the middle of the night is so blissfully
free of distractions that I&#8217;m going to really struggle to find a comparable
work environment during the daytime. Joe Collins was right &#8211; sleep is good.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve adopted various tools and techniques to help keep my life in order and
compensate for my poor memory: Remember the Milk, for a running To Do list,
Google Calendar, to see where I need to be right now, and I&#8217;ve been striving
towards &#8220;Inbox Zero&#8221; (although I admit I haven&#8217;t gotten anywhere near it in
the last few weeks.)</p>

<p>With regards to extracurriculars, I&#8217;m reaching the point where I have to start
prioritizing and saying no to people. While I still wrote for mathNEWS, I
don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve attended more than one &#8220;full&#8221; production night this term; the
alternating VeloCity dinners happened to sync up with the fortnightly
production nights. I&#8217;ve tried to keep up with other duties (March Break Open
House, FIRST Lego League, Math Endowment Fund) and try new things (attending
the Canadian Undergraduate Software Engineering Conference), although I think
I will need to cut back somewhat in the Fall.</p>

<p>On health, I&#8217;ve been neglecting it somewhat, primarily due to tight finances
from last term. I still have not had my wisdom teeth removed, nor have I
obtained a spare pair of glasses (even though my primary pair failed the
morning we went to CUSEC). I don&#8217;t eat all three meals every day, and I&#8217;ve had
mood swings (combination of hunger, fatigue, and unrealistic expectations).</p>

<p>On tangiibles, I&#8217;ve placed an order for a Raspberry Pi. I was hoping to start
using it this term and return Robert Elder&#8217;s old laptop, but the device isn&#8217;t
slated to ship until May. Alas. I am further indebted to him again.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s the wonderful people here at VeloCity that help me
<a href="http://alexisohanian.com/keep-calm-carry-on-what-you-didnt-know-about">keep calm, carry on</a>
and get through the troughs in the
<a href="http://zakhomuth.com/sad-tired-and-alone-my-ongoing-battle-with-st-39237">roller coaster</a>
of life. Way too many people to list here, although Jinny, Joanne, Fang-Ying,
Alcina, Christophe, and Patrick Leo Tardif are definitely at the top of the list.
Where else can you wake up at 1 AM and have someone remark to you,
&#8221;<em>It snowed wonderfully outside last night, so we went outside to trample
all over the field</em>&#8221;?</p>

<p>So, it&#8217;s like, 7:59 AM, EDT. Normally, this would be bedtime for this term.
Except, there&#8217;s an 8:30 AM lab today. So sleep will have to wait a few more
hours. Alas.</p>

<p>Today was the 5th <a href="http://sehackday.com/">SE Hack Day</a>. I decided to
build a Windows Phone 7 application for
<a href="http://petersobot.com">Peter Sobot</a>&#8217;s laundry-tracking app
<a href="http://lndr.me/">lndr.me</a>.</p>

<p>Having the toolkit and phone already set up and knowing to use Json.NET
really helped make things go more smoothly.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><ol>
<li>Preheat oven to <strong>400 F (205 C)</strong></li>
<li>Line a <strong>cookie sheet</strong> with <strong>aluminum foil</strong>.</li>
<li>Spread <strong>four slices of bread</strong> with <strong>mayonaise</strong> on the &#8220;outer&#8221;
edges (since you&#8217;ll be making sandwiches).</li>
<li>Place a <strong>cheese slice</strong> between each pair of slices of bread,
laying the sandwiches on the cookie sheet.</li>
<li>Bake for <strong>four to six minutes</strong>, then <strong>flip</strong> the sandwiches
and bake for <strong>another three to five minutes</strong>. Note that the
sandwich will brown on the bottom (the side facing the foil), and
not on the visible (top) side when it&#8217;s in the oven.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Tips and Suggestions</h2>

<ul>
<li>Use real mayonaise, not &#8220;salad dressing&#8221;, as this intended to
promote browning and needs a decent fat content. If mayonaise is
not available, you could probably substitute margarine or butter.</li>
<li>I tested this with &#8220;Thin Sandwich&#8221; bread, which has 24 slices in a
single loaf, and with &#8220;Thick&#8221; cheese slices. You&#8217;ll want to adjust
the baking time and temperature if using something different.</li>
<li>You can probably fit three sandwiches on a cookie sheet, but I
can&#8217;t eat that much all at once.</li>

<li>Preheat oven to <strong>400 F (205 C)</strong></li>
<li>Line a <strong>cookie sheet</strong> with <strong>aluminum foil</strong>.</li>
<li>Wash <strong>10 asparagus shoots (about half a bunch)</strong> and trim the
bottom 1cm.</li>
<li>Wrap each asparagus shoot with a <strong>slice of bacon</strong> in a single
helix, and lay on the wrapped asparagus on the lined cookie
sheet in a single layer.</li>
<li>Bake for about <strong>20 minutes</strong> until bacon is cooked to desired
doneness.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Tips and Suggestions</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Sometimes I prepare this at 375 F (190 C) to match another dish in
the oven. You may need to bake for a little longer if you do this.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Variant</strong>: Cover half of the shoots with <strong>barbeque sauce</strong>.
I&#8217;ve tried using Diana&reg; Sauce (Maple), though substituting
another variety should work. It&#8217;s normal for a small amount of the
sauce to start charring on the foil. I find that covering all the
shoots with barbeque sauce is intoxicatingly rich, so I don&#8217;t
usually do it if I plan on eating them all by myself.</p></li>
<li><p>If not serving immediately, drain excess bacon fat either
into the trash or into a bowl for later use. (Do not put down the
drain, as it will usually clog.)</p></li>
